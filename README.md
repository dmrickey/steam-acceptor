# steam-acceptor

Automatically clicks the checbkox for accepting the EULA on steam when you're redeeming a key from a direct link from another site (like humble bundle). Locally install this as a chrome extension -- it may work in firefox but the manifest may need to change. It doesn't use any apis so the code won't need to change.

caveat - can't automatically click the register button either because of the site itself, or because I just didn't add the proper permissions to the manifest.
